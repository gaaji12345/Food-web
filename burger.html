        Sure, burgers are a <strong> popular food item consisting </strong> of a cooked ground meat patty, typically beef, though other meats such as chicken, turkey, or plant-based substitutes like veggie or bean patties are also used. The patty is usually placed inside a
         sliced bun and often topped with various ingredients such as cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or special sauces. Burgers are commonly served with side dishes like fries, coleslaw, or salad. They're enjoyed worldwide and have many variations and regional specialties
